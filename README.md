# SearXNG-Web-Extension (Unofficial)

# SearXNG

**SearXNG** is a free Internet metasearch engine that aggregates results from various search services and databases. Users are not tracked or profiled.

[**SearXNG**](https://github.com/searxng/searxng) is a fork of [**SearX**](https://github.com/searx/searx).

[**Original SearXNG repository on GitHub**](https://github.com/searxng/searxng).

[**SearXNG instances**](https://searx.space/) - you can use other instances of the SearXNG search engine (for this you will need to fork the repository and replace the link for the search query in `manifest.json`).

# How does extension work?
Extension use `manifest.json` settings which change your main search engine.

Example:

**Default settings**
```json
{
  "chrome_settings_overrides": {
    "search_provider": {
      "search_url": "https://example.com/search?q={searchTerms}"
    }
  }
}
```

**With addon**
```json
{
  "chrome_settings_overrides": {
    "search_provider": {
      "search_url": "https://searx.be/search?q={searchTerms}"
    }
  }
}
```

It means that your browser starts to use second link when you make search request.

# Tricks with extension
If you want use **SearXNG** as support to main search engine do this:
1. add this addon into your browser
2. agree when browser shows you **"Add this extension?"**
3. disagree when browser shows **"Do you want change your main search engine?"**
4. use keywords like `@searxng, @searx, @sx` if you want use **SearXNG** when you make request
